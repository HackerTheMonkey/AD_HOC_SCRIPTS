Ways to increase Data load performance in SQLLDR

1- Use direct path load by setting the DIRECT=TRUE in the sqlldr command line parameters

2- disable indexes and constraints

3- Use unrecoverable.  The unrecoverable option (unrecoverable load data) disables the writing of the data to the redo logs.  
     This option is available for direct path loads only, this option is a control file parameter which should be inserted before the LOAD DATA statement
